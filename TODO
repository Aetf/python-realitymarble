Fix owner and mode when collect

ScriptMarble should add execution bit when collect

remove empty directory after drop

Implement expand: expand an existing reality marble, project all config files 

Implement project: make a symlink outside pointing to the file in reality marble
Implement materialize: make a outside symlink pointing to reality marble be a normal file, but with out delete it in reality marble

Implement drop over directory
Implement dropall: drop all config files in reality marble
Implement collect over directory, may need some kind of exclude list

Implement init: initialize a new reality marble
Implement new: add a new config file in reality marble and project it into the system

Implement mv: rename an existing reality marble. A naive implication would be first drop, mv, then collect 

More marble types

[DONE] Implement collect: collect a outside normal file into reality marble and make it a symlink
[DONE] Implement drop: materialize the file and remove it from reality marble

[DONE] Minimal log system
